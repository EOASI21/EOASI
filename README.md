# EOASI
EOASI = Encyclopedia of Australian Science and Innovation
It is public knowledge web resource comprising relatively referenced html/htm pages and associtated image, pdf and css files in a standardised folder structure - the static graph.
The data is curated using the Online Heritage Resource Manager (OHRM) which is built on MS Access. The associated VBA code produces the static graph output via a 'wizard' that enables the output to be customised to a limited extent.
The output is produced as a series of editions with the name of each edition registered in the footer.
